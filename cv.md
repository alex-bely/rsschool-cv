## About me

### I am a software developer having experience in two projects. The first one was a CRM system. I was in charge of the back-end development of some financial operations and simple DevOps automation. The second project is from the Legal area. It is an electronic discovery software and I participated in both back-end and front-end development.

### Besides my everyday work involved a lot of communication via different channels: emails, meetings, instant chatting. I am familiar with teamwork and cooperation.

### Now I have a long job break because of military service but I want to prepare for my returning learning new stuff about front-end development.

## Skills

### As a back-end developer I'm experienced with .NET Framework, .NET-compatible programming languages (C#/VB.NET) and some related technologies like SQL-databases, Azure Cloud infrastructure.

### My front-end experience includes JavaScript programming using Backbone library and JQuery/Underscore.js underneath.

### Also I'm familiar with Azure Devops services: team boards, repositories, CI/CD pipelines.
